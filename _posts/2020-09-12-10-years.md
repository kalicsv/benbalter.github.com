Today marks exactly ten years since [my first blog post](https://ben.balter.com/2010/09/12/wordpress-resume-plugin/). The year was 2010 and the job market was tough. I was looking for a way to get my foot in the door of legal industry. I had the domain, but with just my resume as the sole page, traffic was in the single digits and my SEO was terrible, so I started blogging keyword-rich (non-insightful) posts at the intersection of law and technology. For some reason, at the time I thought prospective employers Googled "DC legal intern with interest in technology", clicked the first result, and that's how they handled hiring. I even took out Google ads at one point (they worked, but not the way I had intended).

[A lot has changed](https://web.archive.org/web/20101123210454/http://ben.balter.com/), since "Benjamin J. Balter", self-described "J.D./M.B.A. Candidate, New Media Fanatic, [and] Documentary Junkie", launched the very blog you're reading today. The word cloud is gone, as is the blogroll, and I'd like to hope the content is _slightly_ more insightful. Over the years I've written a lot about open source, government IT and procurement, collaborative workflows, product management, and trust and safety. In honor of the milestone, and in true listicle form, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on my top ten most viewed posts over the past ten years:

<ol reversed="">
{% for post in page.posts %}
<li markdown="1">
[{{ post[0] }}]({{ post[1] }})
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ol>

Thanks for reading and sharing. Here's to the next ten years of rants and rambles! :tada:
